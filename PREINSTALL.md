Use this extension to convert text written to a Cloud Firestore collection to a QR code and store it in Firebase Storage.

This extension listens to your specified Cloud Firestore collection. If you add a string to a specified field in any document within that collection, this extension:

- Converts the text into a QR code png image using the [QR Code Generator API](https://goqr.me/api).
- Saves the converted QR code image to Firebase Storage.
- Saves the path for the image in Firestore.

If the original field of the document is updated, then the original QR code image will be automatically updated, as well.
